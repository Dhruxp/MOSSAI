# MOSSAI

MOSSAI is my personal **machine learning and AI learning workspace**, where I explore concepts through
hands-on notebooks, experiments, and small deployable projects.

This repository also serves as the **submission hub for Manipal Open Source Society (MOSS)** initiatives
and related project work.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The goal of MOSSAI is to:
- Learn machine learning **from fundamentals**
- Translate theory into **working code**
- Build confidence with real tools used in industry
- Maintain a clean, version-controlled learning log

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch  
- **Concepts:**  
  - Data preprocessing  
  - Model training & evaluation  
  - Neural networks  
  - Loss functions & optimizers  
- **Workflow:** Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks

---

## 📓 Notebooks

The notebooks in this repository focus on:
- Understanding ML concepts step-by-step  
- Implementing models from scratch where possible  
- Experimenting with datasets and parameters  
- Visualizing results and debugging intuitively  

Each notebook is treated as a **learning artifact**, not just final code.

---

## 🚀 Projects

The `projects/` directory contains small but complete AI/ML applications where:
- Models are trained and evaluated
- Logic is structured beyond notebooks
- Concepts are applied to real problems

Some projects may later be extended or deployed.

## 📤 MOSS Submissions

All work related to **Manipal Open Source Society (MOSS)** — including assignments, learning tracks,
and project submissions — is organized under the `submissions/` directory.

This ensures:
- Clear separation between learning and deliverables
- Transparency and reproducibility
- Easy review and collaboration

---

## 📌 Notes

- This repository is **actively evolving**
- Code quality and structure improve over time
- Learning progress is prioritized over perfection
